git add . (everything that has been changed)
git diff (everything that has been added and changed)

git add the file you need to add
git commit with git commit -m "what you did"
git push origin master

You need to be in the document (ls is like double click, cd ..)

always contextual where you are

cd is to click/enter on the folder
ls is to see

cat training.txt(file name) gives you the content
ctrl c - stop if cod eis running too much
