git add . (everything that has been changed)
git diff (everything that has been added and changed)

git add the file you need to add
git commit with git commit -m "what you did"
git push origin master

You need to be in the document (ls is like double click, cd ..)
cd ../ is the back button

git pull 

git log gives me the history

ls -a (shows the hidden elemnt, usually not needed)

go to folder (right click new folder to the document) or directly from the command line, 
rm + "name of the file" = you remove it
> "name of the file".txt will create a new file
echo + any text gives you any text in output
echo comment cava >training.txt

always contextual where you are

cd is to click/enter on the folder
ls is to see

cat training.txt(file name) gives you the content
ctrl c - stop if cod eis running too much
